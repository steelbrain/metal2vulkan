//! A texture's extent at a level read from a buffer, ported from `runtime_lane::level_sizes`.
//!
//! A shader may ask for `get_width(lod)` at a level the texture does not have, and Metal answers
//! something rather than refusing: `max(1, e >> (lod & 255))` of the first level's extent, a shift
//! of 32 or more answering 1. The lane holds that as a rule measured on this M3 Max, so the lane's
//! own check is the rule against itself.
//!
//! **The port re-measures it here.** Record mode runs both kernels on Metal at every level of
//! `LEVELS`, so each recording holds Metal's own words and the rule becomes a committed
//! cross-check (the test `every_recorded_extent_is_the_lanes_rule`). The levels are the ones that
//! make the rule visible: inside the texture's three levels, past them, at 31 and 32 (a shift the
//! width of the word), at 255 and 256 (where Metal takes the level's low eight bits), and at
//! `u32::MAX`.
//!
//! Two cases, because they ask two different things of a device: a **sampled** 2D texture, whose
//! size queries the shader makes of the texture itself, and a pair of **storage** textures (a 2D
//! one and a cube), whose level count a storage image cannot query at all, so the binder pushes
//! it. A venue that holds neither is two honest gaps rather than one hidden by the other.
//!
//! Every texture is private and holds nothing: the case reads size queries, not texels, so there
//! is nothing to upload and nothing a venue's layout could change.
//!
//! Nothing here can fault a GPU: one compute pass a level, one thread, no texel read or write, no
//! loop.
