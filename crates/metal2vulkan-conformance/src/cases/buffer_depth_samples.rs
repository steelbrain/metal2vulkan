//! A buffer copied into every sample of a multisample depth or stencil texture, and copied back
//! out: ported from `runtime_lane::buffer_depth_samples`.
//!
//! The lane's Metal answer was a **rule**, not a table — "each copy unit of the buffer lands in its
//! sample by the layout measured for colour, texel `(x, y)` sample `s` at
//! `offset + y * bytesPerRow + (x * n + s) * bpp`, the samples outside a region keep the clear, and
//! the copy back out returns the buffer bit for bit" — written down from a probe on an **Apple M4**,
//! a machine this round does not have. Every call on the path is public: a render pass that clears
//! and draws nothing, `copyFromBuffer:toTexture:` into the depth or stencil aspect, a dispatch that
//! reads every sample, and `copyFromTexture:toBuffer:` back. So record mode **runs** these cases on
//! the oracle and the rule becomes Metal's own numbers on this M3 Max, re-takeable whenever
//! anybody asks. Nothing is carried from the dead M4.
//!
//! **One case per row**, as the multisample fill family does, so a sample count the venue does not
//! render stops that row alone and the suite counts it
//! [`LacksFeature`](crate::verdict::Verdict::LacksFeature) rather than leaving it uncompared.
//! lavapipe does not render 2 samples, which Vulkan leaves optional, and the lane's own loop prints
//! a line and carries on. It also keeps every recording far under the 512 KiB the plan allows: the
//! largest row is an 80 x 80 texture at 4 samples, whose two reads are 100 KiB each.
//!
//! The first row is the consumer's screensaver's copy (`Depth32Float` 54 x 54 at 4 samples, whole,
//! `bytesPerRow` 864) and the second its login window's at HiDPI (80 x 80, `bytesPerRow` 1280);
//! the rest sweep the sample count, a region inside the texture, and the two other aspects.
//!
//! Two sites a row:
//!
//! - `samples` is what the dispatch read, texel by texel in rows with each texel's samples in
//!   order — **where each copy unit landed**, which is the rule's first half.
//! - `copied-back` is the second buffer after the copy out, made holding `0xee` so that a byte the
//!   copy did not write is visible rather than indistinguishable from a copy that wrote zero.
//!
//! A `Depth32Float` row's buffer opens with 16 edge words — signed zeros, the smallest and largest
//! denormals, 1 and the float after it, 2, -1, both infinities, three NaN payloads, the largest
//! float — because the question the lane asks is whether anything on the path quietens, flushes or
//! clamps one. Recording Metal's answer to that is the point: a device that changes such a value
//! announces it, and the announcement is then held to the recorded fact rather than to prose.
//!
//! Nothing here faults a GPU, hangs one or trips a watchdog: one command buffer a row, a clear that
//! draws nothing, two blits and one dispatch of a thread a sample.
