//! Visible-function tables, swept: the handles a pipeline state gives, the table it makes, the
//! entries a case writes into it, and what a shader calls through it.
//!
//! # What the suite measured before this
//!
//! **Nothing.** `MTLVisibleFunctionTable.h` and `MTLFunctionHandle.h` were two of the four SDK
//! headers with no exercised item at all, and the two selector pairs that reach them — a compute
//! state's `functionHandleWithFunction:` and `newVisibleFunctionTableWithDescriptor:`, and the
//! `:stage:` spellings a render state has — were unexercised beside them. The only visible-table
//! items any case reached were `MTLArgumentEncoder`'s two, which write a table's *resource ID*
//! into an argument buffer without ever making one. So every claim the runtime makes about a
//! handle, a table, an entry or a table call rested on prose and on its own interpreter.
//!
//! # Why this family executes rather than reads back
//!
//! A table's getters are a count the case itself set, a label, and a resource identifier that is
//! the host's own number. A family built on those would compare a round trip. What a table is
//! *for* is the call, and the owned fixture `engine/visible_table_caller` makes the call a vector
//! of words ([`crate::visible_tables`] prints its four answers). Over twelve threads a table
//! holding `[table_add, table_mul]` writes `3, 3, 5, 9, 7, 15, …` and the **same table holding
//! `[table_mul, table_add]`** writes `0, 4, 6, 6, 12, 8, …`.
//!
//! That pair is the family's control and it is what makes the whole sweep non-vacuous: the words
//! depend on *which function each entry holds*, so a side that bound a table correctly but
//! numbered its handles by name, by library order, or by anything but the order of
//! `MTLLinkedFunctions.functions` reads one vector where the other belongs. No amount of binding
//! plumbing turns one into the other.
//!
//! # Which values move the observation, and which cannot
//!
//! - **`functionCount` 0, 1, 2, 3 each move the words**, and by construction: the shader calls
//!   entry `tid % size`, so the size decides which thread calls what, and a size of 0 takes the
//!   empty-table branch instead. Four of four sizes a case may ask.
//! - **The device's maximum `functionCount` is unexercised by choice.** A table's allocation is
//!   one word an entry over a buffer of the device's `max_buffer_length`, and Metal **ended the
//!   process** on an M4 from 2³¹ entries (recorded in the runtime's `function_table.rs`). The
//!   sweep stops at 3 rather than discovering that again.
//! - **A table of no entries and a table whose entries are all nil are different rows**, and
//!   Metal distinguishes them: the shader's `size()` guard writes `0xfffffffe` for the first and
//!   its null-entry guard writes `0xfffffffd` for the second. Two rows, two answers, not one row
//!   asked twice.
//! - **An unbound index moves it again**, to `0xffffffff`: Metal's null table, which is what an
//!   index nothing was bound at reads as.
//! - **Both entry setters are swept and are *not* indistinguishable by construction.**
//!   `setFunctions:withRange:` writes the same two entries `setFunction:atIndex:` writes, so the
//!   two rows are expected to agree — and a side that implemented the range form as "the first
//!   handle, repeated", that ignored its `location`, or that wrote the range backwards reads a
//!   different vector at exactly that row.
//! - **A `functionCount` of 3 with two entries written** leaves the third as the creation left it.
//!   Expected to agree with nothing else in the sweep: its words hold `0xfffffffd` where the
//!   nil-entry row holds one and the size-3 row holds `table_sub`'s answer.
//! - **`MTLLinkedFunctions.privateFunctions` against `functions` moves the handle.** The private
//!   row links all four functions and puts `table_sub` alone in `privateFunctions`, so against the
//!   size-3 row — which links the same four and gets `table_sub`'s handle — it differs at exactly
//!   that handle. That is the whole claim about the list: a function reachable by a
//!   visible-function reference but holding no table word.
//! - **A private function and an unlinked one are two rows, not one.** The private row keeps
//!   `table_half` callable and the unlinked row links neither it nor `table_sub`, so the two
//!   differ at `handle/table_half`. Written the obvious way — the private row linking only the two
//!   it needed — the two transcripts came out **byte-identical** and one of them compared nothing;
//!   the recordings said so, and the rows were separated for that reason.
//! - **Neither row moves the words.** `table_add` and `table_mul` hold the same positions among
//!   the callable functions in all three, so the dispatch reads the base two-entry vector and the
//!   handles are the only sites that move. That is the point: the two rows are about the handle
//!   selector, and a row whose words also moved could not say which call the difference came
//!   from.
//! - **The `MTLRenderStages` sweep moves the handle and not the words.** Of the five single
//!   stages, `MTLRenderStageVertex` is the one the case's state has a function of, so it alone
//!   answers a handle; `MTLRenderStageFragment`, `MTLRenderStageTile`, `MTLRenderStageObject` and
//!   `MTLRenderStageMesh` answer no handle and still **make** a table, which is the runtime's
//!   claim under test. `MTLRenderStageVertex | MTLRenderStageFragment` answers both nil. Five of
//!   five single values and one compound; the empty set is unexercised by choice because plain
//!   Metal **faults** on a table of no stage (an M4 under macOS 27.0.1, recorded in the runtime).
//!
//! # What is deliberately not a case
//!
//! **An entry holding a function of another type.** `table_half` is `float(float)` and the table
//! is `uint(uint, uint)`; Metal's own documentation makes a call through the wrong type
//! undefined, so a case comparing it would be comparing undefined behaviour on two
//! implementations and would pin whatever this machine happened to do. The *handle* of
//! `table_half` is asked for and compared — that is defined — and no case places it.
//!
//! **A handle of another pipeline state in another state's table.** Metal's validation stops it
//! and plain Metal's answer was never measured, so every handle every case here places comes from
//! the state that made the table.
//!
//! **A dispatch through a render stage's table.** The two `:stage:` selectors are what this family
//! reaches, and it reaches them by making the state, taking the handle and making the table. The
//! vertex and tile *callers* exist as committed fixtures and executing them is a round of its own.
//!
//! # Why this family is safe
//!
//! Each case makes two libraries, one pipeline state, at most two tables of at most three
//! entries, and the compute cases encode one dispatch of twelve single-thread threadgroups over a
//! 48-byte buffer. Nothing is sampled, no texture is made, no attachment is written and no case
//! waits on anything but its own command buffer. The three shapes with a recorded way to end a
//! process — a table of no stage, a table near the device's maximum, and a handle of another
//! state — are each named above and reached by no case.
//!
//! # Exactness
//!
//! Every field is a number, a name, an enumerator or a bool. The family declares no tolerance and
//! announces nothing: no float, no texture object and no sampler is touched.
