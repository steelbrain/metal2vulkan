"""The suite's depth in each Metal enum and option set: which of a type's values it compared.

`coverage.py`'s other axis is **reachability**: an item counts as exercised where a case's Metal
leg calls it, so one call is enough and a selector that takes an enum says nothing about how many
of that enum's values ever reached Metal. This is the second axis, over the values themselves.

The denominator is generated, never written here: `crates/metal2vulkan/src/metal/generated.rs` and
`crates/metal2vulkan-air/src/metal/generated.rs` hold every enumerator name and ordinal of the
Metal types `scripts/regen-metal-enums/` extracts from the SDK headers. A Metal type the tree
models by hand instead has **no denominator here** and is reported as such rather than guessed at;
the fix is appending its name to that script's lists and regenerating.

The numerator is two derived sets, which are different claims and are kept apart:

- **answered** — the enumerator's name appears in a committed recording's transcript of an answer
  Metal **ran**. Metal named the value back to us at a site the comparison reads, so the value is
  in the compared text itself.
- **in effect** — a case module's own text names the value, and that module has at least one case
  whose recording is a Metal run. Metal's recorded answer was taken with the value in effect, so
  the comparison is of Metal's behaviour **under** that value even where no site reads it back.

`compared` is their union. A value that only the suite's **shared** sources name (a default of the
render vocabulary, say) is counted in neither: some case puts it to Metal, but which case is not a
property of the text, so it is reported in its own column and is neither compared nor missing.

# What the floor is made of

Every column here is a floor, and the honest thing is to say what of rather than only that it is
one. Two things, and as far as has been measured no third:

1. **A value a case states as a raw ordinal**, which the next section is about. Measured where it
   can be: the document lists each type a recorded module names and states no value of by name,
   which is how a sweep over `0..n` reads, so the floor has a work list and not just a warning.
2. **A spelling of a value that `_stated_in` does not read.** A name written in a shape the
   reading does not cover is counted nowhere and looks exactly like a value no case reaches.
   `_stated_in` lists every shape read and `_resolved` is the one rule they all go through, so a
   shape not on that list is the floor. Two have been found, both by someone checking a printed
   count against the code rather than by this file, which is the evidence for taking the unknown
   seriously rather than calling it small.

What is **not** part of the floor, because it is measured: the generated denominator (every type
`regen-metal-enums` covers, by `ENUMS`, `OPTIONS` or `TABLE_ONLY`), the `#[cfg(test)]` exclusion,
Metal's validation leg, and which case put a value in effect. A type the tree models by hand and
says so nowhere on the item is outside both tables and so outside the axis, which the document
states where it lists them.

# The crossings, which are the pairs rather than the values

Every column above is per value, and a type whose values are all compared says nothing about the
pairs of them. `crossings.tsv` is the declaration of the pairs: one row a crossing, naming the case
module, the cell the falsification is read at, the Metal types crossed, and what only the cross
decides. It is a **declaration**, so what makes it worth reading is not the list but what the
derivation refuses:

- a module no case of which ran Metal, and a cell that is not one of that module's recorded cases;
- an axis that is not a Metal enum or option set with a generated value list;
- fewer than two axes, or one axis twice;
- an axis of which the module's own text states fewer than two values by name, which is the one
  check that bears on the claim itself: a module that cannot vary the axis cannot hold a cross over
  it, so a single-value falsification would satisfy the row.

What the derivation cannot check is whether the expected answer **needs** both axes. That is a
property of the case's reasoning, not of its text, so the row states it in words for a reader and
the count is of crossings declared, never of crossings proved. The document says so where it
prints the number.

# The crossings that are not pairs of the option space

A crossing of a Metal enum with a **boolean** field (`alphaToCoverageEnabled`), with a **number**
(an extent, a level count, an offset, a sample count), or of one type with **itself in two slots**
(the two stencil faces, a sampler's three address modes, two members of an argument buffer) is real
depth and is not a pair of the option space. `crossings.tsv` refuses every one of those, which left
the shape of them stated as a limit and measured at nothing: a reader could not tell whether one
such crossing or forty fell outside the count.

`other_crossings.tsv` is where they are declared, counted **apart** from the pairs and never added
into one number -- the same separation `unreachable_values.tsv` keeps between a measured
impossibility and a gap. Its rows take the same four fields, and the axes are of two kinds:

- a Metal enum or option set with a generated value list, which **may** be named more than once:
  that repetition is the type-in-two-slots crossing, and the count of slots is the count of names;
- `MTLType.item`, one Metal item of one Metal type, spelled as the items axis keys it --
  `MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor.alphaToCoverageEnabled`,
  `MTLArgumentEncoder.setArgumentBuffer:offset:`.

What this second file refuses, beyond the shape checks the first one makes:

- a row every axis of which is a Metal enum named once, which is a pair of the option space and
  belongs in `crossings.tsv` under its checks, not here under weaker ones;
- an `MTLType.item` axis `objc2-metal` binds no such item for, and one **this module's Metal leg
  does not reach** -- the same join the items axis makes, so a field axis names a call the suite
  is already measured to make;
- an `MTLType.item` axis whose call **answers a Metal type with a generated value list**. Such a
  field is an enum under another name, and declaring it here would dodge the pairs file's check
  that the module states two of its values. `MTLTextureDescriptor.storageMode` is one.

What it cannot check, and what no reading of the sources could: that the module puts **two values**
of a boolean or numeric field to Metal. The enum axes carry that check here as they do in the pairs
file -- the module's own text must state two values by name -- and a field axis carries only that
the field is Metal's and that this module's Metal leg sets it. So a field axis is a weaker
declaration than an enum axis, which is why the two counts stay apart and why the document says
which part only a reader can check.

# Why a value stated as a raw ordinal is not resolved, and must not be

Both numerators read **names**. A case may instead hand the Metal leg an enum's ordinal as a
number — a sweep over `0..n`, or a literal field — and such a value appears nowhere by name, so
every column reads short of what the case does. That is stated as a limit in the document rather
than worked around, because the obvious way to close it is unsound:

the leg types some of these fields itself (`MTLPixelFormat(request.format as usize)` says that
`format` holds a pixel format's ordinal), which invites reading every `format: <number>` in the
suite as a pixel format. It is not one. `recording.rs` declares `format: u32` for the **recording
format's version**, so `format: 1` there is version 1 and not `MTLPixelFormatA8Unorm`, and a rule
keyed on the field's name would quietly credit the suite with a value nothing ever set. One
vocabulary's word for a thing is not another's.

So the floor stays a floor and says so. Closing it properly means a case stating its values by
name, or a transcript site recording the enumerator beside the ordinal it already stores — not a
cleverer reading of the text here.

    These are counted apart from the pairs and never added into them: a crossing of a type with a
    boolean or numeric field, or of a type with itself in two or more slots, is real depth and is
    **not** a pair of the option space, which is what the columns above and `crossings.tsv` measure.

    `items` is every Metal item a field axis may name, keyed as the items axis keys it, holding the
    case modules whose Metal leg reaches it and the Metal type its call answers.

    What is refused here that `crossings` does not refuse:

    - a row every axis of which is a Metal enum named **once**. That is a pair of the option space:
      it belongs in `crossings.tsv`, under the check that the module states two values of each
      axis, and a row parked here would be the same claim under a weaker rule;
    - a field axis naming an item `objc2-metal` binds nothing for, and one **this module's own
      data never reaches**: the leg must hold a call of that field at a site whose guards this
      module's text satisfies. The reachability half is the items axis's own join, so a field axis
      names a call the suite is measured to make rather than a word chosen here; the guard half is
      what makes it a claim about that **field** and not about any field of its Metal type, since
      one shared encoder sets fifty fields of a descriptor and every case reaches all fifty;
    - a field axis whose call answers a Metal type with a generated value list. Such a field is an
      enum under another name, and naming it as a field would dodge the two-values check that the
      enum spelling carries.

    Everything `crossings` refuses is refused here too, by the same helpers: the cell must be one
    of the module's recorded cases, and an enum axis -- repeated or not -- must be one the module's
    own text states two values of.

    What **cannot** be checked, for a field axis, is that the module put two values of the field to
    Metal. The guard check reads that the module states the field, not which values it states: a
    boolean's two values and a number's range are nowhere in the text this reads, and nothing in a
    recording names them, so that part of a field row is what only a reader can check. The document
    says so where it prints the count.

    Two dicts, because they are two claims of different strength and were one number:

    - **answered**: the value is in what a site **observed**, which is Metal's own answer. This is
      the strong claim the document makes for the column -- Metal named the value back at a site
      the comparison reads.
    - **at a site**: the value is in a site's **name**. The comparison does read those names, and
      pairs sites by them, so the value is in the compared text and the case did put it to Metal.
      But it is the case's label and not Metal's answer, so it is no evidence that Metal **said**
      the value, and folding it into the first overstated what the recording holds.

    Both are inside *compared*, so no total moves; what moves is which column carries them.

    Only `answers[].outcomes[].transcript` is read. An answer's `validated` leg is Metal's API
    validation, which the suite records and **never compares**, and its complaints name
    enumerators; reading it would count Apple's prose as a comparison. The cost and timing tables
    are not read either: a site name there is what was measured, not an answer that was compared.
